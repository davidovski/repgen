I work at a Grocery/Retail store. I am one of those personal shoppers and I am the one that gets the stuff off of the shelves for the customers. I used to work overnight doing mods (rearranging stuff on shelves) but after finding out I was pregnant and told management, they tried to put me at part time so they didn’t have to pay benefits so I went to days. 

Yesterday I was picking stuff for customers orders around 6 am when the overnight crew is still there. One of my old coworkers, who I don’t like, came up to me and said “Every time I see you, you keep getting fatter and fatter”. I am currently 34 weeks pregnant, and I haven’t gained any weight due because of the low sodium diet I am on (everything that tastes so good has salt) so whatever weight I did gain I lost. I just looked at her and said “First of all that is rude, Second if that is the only thing you are going to say to me I would rather you not talk to me”. She just stood there fumbling her words trying to change the subject and I just walked off. 

Why do people think that can just say whatever they want to you because you are pregnant?
