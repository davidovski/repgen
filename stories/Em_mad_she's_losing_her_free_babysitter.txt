This is a pretty short story that happened about 20 yrs ago (give or take).  So I was a very new adult, & ready to flee the nest ASAP.  I'm casually talking about it with my mom, & my EM sister happened to be there (she came over every day so she wouldn't have to take care of her kid).  I don't remember the exact dialogue, so much of it is summarized.  

Upon hearing about my move, she butts in "What about Nephew??!ðŸ˜¡"  I take a second to process this... did she just say that?  Yep, she did.  "Uhhhh... what about nephew??".  "You're just gonna leave him?"  "He's... not my kid?  He has a mom & a dad. You can't expect me to live at home forever because nephew will miss me."  "But he's attached to you, & who's gonna take care of him while I'm in school?"  "Well... you'll just have to find someone... surely you knew I would move out at some point?"  "Yea but why do you have to move so far away?! (30 miles)". "I'll still see nephew, and you guys can visit anytime."  

At that point nephew comes in.  I don't remember if he overheard or not, but my sister angrily gestures towards him & makes a series of disgusted sounds as if to say 'how could you do this to him?!'  

At this point, I'm done.  She's just mad about losing her free babysitter.ðŸ™„ My mom kind of just stood there with a shocked expression.  We know she's like this, but she still manages to surprise us from time to time.  I moved out, & enjoyed not living close enough for her to drop off my (as much as I love him) holy terror nephew.

Stay tuned for more, bc I have a lifetime of stories lmao ðŸ˜†
